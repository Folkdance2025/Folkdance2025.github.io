    "title": "About Folk Dance",
    "paragraphs": [
       "The term 'World Folk Dance' is derived from the English 'Folk Dance.' Its formation is influenced by geography, climate, customs, and historical background, resulting in a variety of unique dance forms. Therefore, the folk dances passed down by various ethnic groups around the world are known as 'World Folk Dance,' also referred to in various regions as 'folk dances' or 'traditional dances.'",
      "In 1957 (Republic of China Year 46), Rickey Holden, an international folk dance expert, introduced World Folk Dance to Taiwan. Since then, it has taken root and flourished on the island, developing a history of over sixty years.",
      "Between the 1960s and 1980s, under the promotion of renowned Taiwanese folk dancers such as Chang Ching-san, Yang Chang-hsiung, and Chen Ji, along with strong support from the China Youth Corps, World Folk Dance became one of the most popular recreational activities at the time. Especially in university student clubs, folk dance clubs ranked among the largest and most active. During summer and winter breaks, activities organized by the China Youth Corps almost always included folk dance as an essential program.",
      "As times changed, World Folk Dance gradually declined, replaced by the now-popular 'mom dances' in community alleys and 'street dance' (also known as 'hip-hop') that are favored by younger generations. Thus, World Folk Dance has become an important memory for those born in the 1960s and 70s, marking a significant and unforgettable chapter in the social and folk development history of Taiwan.",
      "Although World Folk Dance is no longer as popular as it was during its golden age, a number of university and community clubs still carry the torch. They continue to promote and practice the art through club showcases, regular activities, international dance camps, and weekend social gatherings.",
      "In 2017 (Republic of China Year 106), the Carnation World Folk Dance Promotion Association, a self-organized club in Taichung, celebrated its 25th anniversary. This grand event gathered community clubs from Taichung and Kaohsiung for a World Folk Dance showcase, receiving high praise and fostering cohesion and mutual exchange among participating groups.",
      "The following year, the Kinmen County Sports Association’s World Folk Dance Association took over the event and officially named it the '2017 Kinmen World Folk Dance Tourism and Arts Festival'. It brought together over 400 dancers from across the Taiwan Strait, boosting Kinmen’s tourism industry and becoming a culturally significant event with multiple layers of value.",
      "In 2018, the 'Joyful Dancers' from Kaohsiung continued the legacy by hosting the '2018 Kaohsiung World Folk Dance Tourism and Arts Festival', helping local residents understand that folk dance reflects cultural lifestyles, rituals, costumes, and ethnic philosophies.",
      "In 2019, the event was organized by Hong Kong’s Global Arts European Ethnic Dance Group, and in addition to performers from Taiwan, Kinmen, Mainland China, and Hong Kong, the festival welcomed groups from Singapore and Malaysia, establishing the event as a platform for annual cultural exchange and friendship among World Folk Dance enthusiasts.",
      "The '2020 Taichung World Folk Dance Tourism and Arts Festival' was originally scheduled to be held but was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After a three-year hiatus from 2020 to 2022, the event resumed in 2023 as the pandemic eased and international borders reopened. With the support of organizations in Singapore and Malaysia, Wu Guo-Ji, founder of the Singaporean 'Yingsi Dance Society,' organized the '2023 Singapore-Malaysia World Folk Dance Tourism and Arts Festival.'",
      "This edition continued the festival’s signature features, combining urban culture, local traditions, and World Folk Dance to allow participants from around the globe to experience the beautiful integration and harmony of the host city’s culture, space, and international folk dance.",
      "Originally rotating among Taichung, Kinmen, Kaohsiung, and Hong Kong, the festival welcomed Singapore and Malaysia as new host regions in 2023. Participating groups and individuals come from Taiwanese, Kinmenese, Hong Kong, Mainland Chinese (Putian, Shanghai), Singaporean, Malaysian, Australian, American, and Canadian Chinese communities. The event has become an important platform for global Chinese communities to connect and understand one another.",
      "After being successfully held in Taichung (2016), Kinmen (2017), Kaohsiung (2018), Hong Kong (2019), and Singapore/Malaysia (2023), the event, due to its large manpower and financial requirements and the lack of public funding, has been adjusted to be held biennially. It is hoped that by compiling related materials and consolidating resources, the series can be sustained long-term, offering a gathering and exchange platform for folk dance lovers across the Chinese-speaking world. In 2025, the festival will return to Kinmen as the host.",
      "The 2025 event is scheduled to be held from August 22 to 24, lasting three days, with optional city and cultural experiences extending the trip to five to seven days. Planned highlights include a welcome dinner and dance party, a World Folk Dance International Forum, folk dance performances, a folk culture market, and cultural exchange activities. The goal is to help global Chinese communities appreciate that Taiwan and Kinmen’s folk culture can coexist and complement the world’s diverse folk traditions—contributing to broadening international perspectives and enhancing awareness of local cultural characteristics."

  "Title": "International Forum on World Folk Dance",
  "description": "Unlike previous events, this year’s program includes an international forum themed 'Local Transmission of World Folk Dance'. Given the significance of world folk dance in broadening global perspectives and promoting cultural integration, raising awareness and embedding it in daily life is essential. However, the current environment in Taiwan poses challenges for its promotion and inheritance. Therefore, this forum, hosted in Kinmen, brings together insights and experiences from global Chinese communities and international participants, aiming to provide valuable references for improving Taiwan’s cultural environment and transmission strategies.",
